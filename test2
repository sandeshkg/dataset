Apache Storm
 
A system for processing streaming data in real time

Apache™ Storm adds reliable real-time data processing capabilities to Enterprise Hadoop. Storm on YARN is powerful for scenarios requiring real-time analytics, machine learning and continuous monitoring of operations.

Storm integrates with YARN via Apache Slider, YARN manages Storm while also considering cluster resources for data governance, security and operations components of a modern data architecture.

What Storm Does

Storm is a distributed real-time computation system for processing large volumes of high-velocity data. Storm is extremely fast, with the ability to process over a million records per second per node on a cluster of modest size. Enterprises harness this speed and combine it with other data access applications in Hadoop to prevent undesirable events or to optimize positive outcomes.

Some of specific new business opportunities include: real-time customer service management, data monetization, operational dashboards, or cyber security analytics and threat detection. 

Here are some typical “prevent” and “optimize” use cases for Storm.



“Prevent” Use Cases

“Optimize” Use Cases


 Financial Services •Securities fraud
•Operational risks & compliance violations
 •Order routing
•Pricing
 
  Telecom •Security breaches
•Network outages
 •Bandwidth allocation
•Customer service
 
  Retail •Shrinkage
•Stock outs
 •Offers
•Pricing
 
  Manufacturing •Preventative maintenance
•Quality assurance
 •Supply chain optimization
•Reduced plant downtime
 
  Transportation •Driver monitoring
•Predictive maintenance
 •Routes
•Pricing
 
  Web •Application failures
•Operational issues
 •Personalized content
 

Now with Storm in Hadoop on YARN, a Hadoop cluster can efficiently process a full range of workloads from real-time to interactive to batch. Storm is simple and developers can write Storm topologies using any programming language.

Five characteristics make Storm ideal for real-time data processing workloads. Storm is:
•Fast – benchmarked as processing one million 100 byte messages per second per node
•Scalable – with parallel calculations that run across a cluster of machines
•Fault-tolerant – when workers die, Storm will automatically restart them. If a node dies, the worker will be restarted on another node.
•Reliable – Storm guarantees that each unit of data (tuple) will be processed at least once or exactly once. Messages are only replayed when there are failures.
•Easy to operate – standard configurations are suitable for production on day one. Once deployed, Storm is easy to operate.
 


How Storm Works

A storm cluster has three sets of nodes:
•Nimbus node (master node, similar to the Hadoop JobTracker): ◦Uploads computations for execution
◦Distributes code across the cluster
◦Launches workers across the cluster
◦Monitors computation and reallocates workers as needed

•ZooKeeper nodes – coordinates the Storm cluster
•Supervisor nodes – communicates with Nimbus through Zookeeper, starts and stops workers according to signals from Nimbus

storm_architecture

Five key abstractions help to understand how Storm processes data:
•Tuples– an ordered list of elements. For example, a “4-tuple” might be (7, 1, 3, 7)
•Streams – an unbounded sequence of tuples.
•Spouts –sources of streams in a computation (e.g. a Twitter API)
•Bolts – process input streams and produce output streams. They can: run functions; filter, aggregate, or join data; or talk to databases.
•Topologies – the overall calculation, represented visually as a network of spouts and bolts (as in the following diagram)

Storm_concepts

Storm users define topologies for how to process the data when it comes streaming in from the spout. When the data comes in, it is processed and the results are passed into Hadoop.

Learn more about how the community is working to integrate Storm with Hadoop and improve its readiness for the enterprise.



Hortonworks Focus for Storm

Apache Storm added open source, stream data processing to Enterprise Hadoop and Hortonworks Data Platform. The Storm community is working to improve capabilities related to three important themes: business continuity, operations and developer productivity. The team is working to deliver high availability (HA), user authentication, advanced scheduling and declarative wiring to Storm.


Focus

Planned Enhancements


Business continuity Enhance Storm’s enterprise readiness with high availability (HA) and failover to standby clusters 
Operations Apache Ambari support for Nimbus HA node setup and elastic topologies via YARN and Apache Slider. Incremental improvements to Storm UI to easily deploy, manage and monitor topologies. 
Enterprise readiness Assist developer productivity with declarative wiring of data sources, spouts and bolts into topologies 



Recent Progress in Storm

The Apache Storm open source community has already begun working on those themes.


Storm Version

Progress


Version 0.9.2 •Netty transport overhaul – significantly improve performance through better utilization of thread, CPU, and network resources
•UI improvements with a new REST API – REST API exposes metrics and operations in JSON format, used by the UI
•Plugable serialization for multilang – enables the use of more performant serialization frameworks than JSON, like protocol buffers
•Apache Kafka spout – for consuming data from Kafka
 
Version 0.9.0 •Netty-based messaging transport
•Log viewer UI
•Improved Windows platform support
•Security improvements
•API compatibility and upgrading

Reduce costs by moving data and processing to Hadoop
 
Incorporate Hadoop to modernize your data architecture and gain significant cost savings. Move high volumes of existing data into Hadoop, offload processing workloads, and enrich your data architecture with additional types of data to create new business value.






Today’s data architectures are strained under the loads placed upon them. Data volumes continue to grow considerably, low value workloads like ETL consume ever more processing resources, and new types of data can’t easily be captured and put to use. Organizations struggle with escalating costs, increasing complexity, and the challenge of expansion.

Data architects use Hadoop to address these challenges, moving high data volumes to Hadoop, offloading ETL processes, and enriching existing data architectures with new data for increased value.

Optimization opens new paths to efficiency

Archive, Offload and Enrich





ARCHIVE


By design, Hadoop runs on low-cost commodity servers and direct attached storage that allows for a dramatically lower overall cost. When compared to high-end storage area networks, the option of scale-out commodity compute and storage using Hadoop provides a compelling alternative —one which allows the user to scale out their hardware only as their data grows. This cost dynamic makes it possible to store, process, access and analyze more data than ever before.

Case Study: Western Digital »




OFFLOAD


The scope of ETL, analytics and operations tasks executed by the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) has grown considerably. The ETL function is a relatively low-value computing workload that can be performed at a lower cost. When offloaded to Hadoop, data is extracted, transformed and then the results are loaded into the data warehouse. The result: critical CPU cycles and storage space are freed for the truly high value functions – analytics and operations – that best leverage its advanced capabilities.

Case Study: Neustar »




ENRICH


An incredible array of new data types opens possibilities for analysis within the high-performance EDW environment. The varied structures of these new data types, however, present challenges for EDWs not designed to ingest and analyze those formats. Many organizations rely on the flexibility of Hadoop to capture, store and refine these new data types to use within the EDW. They take advantage of the ability to define schema upon read in Hadoop, gathering and storing data in any format and creating schema to support analysis in the EDW when necessary.
